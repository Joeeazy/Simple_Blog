          <li>
            Impact: The web application experienced intermittent downtime,
            resulting in slow response times and partial service disruption.
            Approximately 20% of users were affected during this period
          </li>
          <li>
            Root Cause: An overloaded cache layer caused increased latency and
            intermittent failures.

        <ul>
          <li>
            March 14, 2024, 10:15 AM (UTC): The issue was detected through
            monitoring alerts showing a significant increase in response time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Actions taken: Initially suspected a database problem, focusing on
            recent schema changes during deployment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Misleading investigation: Attention was directed towards the
            database cluster.
          </li>
          <li>
            Escalation: The incident was escalated to the database
            administration team for assessment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Resolution: The infrastructure team adjusted the cache configuration
            and implemented a monitoring system.
          </li>

        <h2>Root Cause and Resolution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The root cause was an overloaded cache layer, evicting frequently
            accessed data due to increased system load.
          </li>
          <li>
            The issue was resolved by adjusting the cache configuration and
            implementing proactive monitoring.
          </li>
